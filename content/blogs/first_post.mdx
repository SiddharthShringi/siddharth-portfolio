Building modern web applications often means balancing speed, scalability, and developer experience. One of the most popular combinations today is **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS**. Next.js provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box, while Tailwind CSS makes styling efficient with utility-first classes.

### Why Next.js?
Next.js is a **React framework** that makes it easy to build production-ready apps. It optimizes performance automatically and provides built-in routing, so you don’t need to worry about complex configurations.

### Why Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom CSS files, you compose styles using pre-defined classes. This speeds up development and ensures a consistent design system.

### Step 1: Create a Next.js App
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
````

### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS

Inside your project folder, install Tailwind CSS with:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then configure your `tailwind.config.js` file to include your project paths.

### Step 3: Use Tailwind in Your Code

You can now use Tailwind classes directly in your components:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-blue-600">
        Hello, Next.js with Tailwind!
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Conclusion

With just a few steps, you now have a blazing-fast React framework powered by Next.js and styled beautifully with Tailwind CSS. This setup is ideal for **portfolio websites, blogs, and scalable applications**. The combination offers **developer productivity** and **modern design** out of the box.

```

Would you like me to also create **2–3 more dummy blogs** (with different topics, titles, and snippets) so you have a small set ready for your portfolio site?
