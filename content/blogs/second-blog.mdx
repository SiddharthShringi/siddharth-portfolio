# My First Dummy Blog ðŸš€

Welcome to my **dummy blog post**!  
This is just some placeholder text to see if the blog system works properly.  

## Why am I writing this?

- To test my blog setup in Next.js  
- To check if frontmatter metadata is being parsed  
- To confirm that styling for headings, lists, and code blocks works  

## Code Example

Hereâ€™s a simple JavaScript snippet:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`;
  console.log(greet("World"));
}
