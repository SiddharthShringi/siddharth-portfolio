# Exploring the Unknown 🌌

This is my **second dummy blog post**.  
The goal is to test if multiple blog entries show up correctly in the blog listing page.

## What’s Inside?

- Another post with unique slug and metadata
- Different publish date
- Unique content to check pagination and routing

## Quote of the Day

> “Not all those who wander are lost.” – J.R.R. Tolkien

## Quick Checklist ✅

- [x] Created frontmatter
- [x] Added content
- [x] Different slug and image

## Wrapping Up

If this blog appears **alongside the first one**, then your blog index page and routing are working as expected. 🚀
